Display copy protected videos in WordPress pages and posts.

== Description ==

Copy protect video with optional watermark. This plugin enables the use of copy protected videos in WordPress posts and pages. The resulting embedded Video object is supported in the ArtisBrowser. 

Note: No other WordPress plugin can prevent all methods of copy on its own. The difference with Copysafe plugins is that they are a tool that enables the use of more efficient copy protection solutions that can interact at system level where copy needs to be actioned.

CopySafe Video provides the most secure protection for videos both online and offline. This plugin displays Video created for use online and when domain lock is applied, the Video file cannot be displayed from anywhere else. With Video now bound to your web site, you are free to apply DRM rules to control access to the page via your WordPress member controls. The ArtisBrowser reports the user's unique computer signature so that you can convert WordPress into a fully fledged DRM Portal by adding a new field to your member's table and some script to compare current ID with the one already assigned.

* Easy install (requires WordPress Classic Editor).
* Insert protected Videos into posts and pages using the [Video] media button.

== Implementation ==

You can upload new Video class documents or select from a list of already uploaded videos. After selecting a video you can then set the security options to apply to the page such as:

* Disable protection from PrintScreen and screen capture.
* Disable the option to view from computers using remote or virtual connections.
* Video width and height.

== Screenshots ==

1. CopySafe Videos can be added at the last position of the cursor by clicking the [Video] button.

3. The above default settings are applied to all CopySafe Video pages and posts.
4. The document file manager will list all uploaded document class files.
